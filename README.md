# Customer Banking System 
## Tracks savings and CD balance and interest earned

This program started with 4 files, Account.py, cd_account.py, customer_banking.py, and saving_account.py, which can be downloaded [here.](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m3/lms/starter/M3_Starter_Code.zip)

The program prompts the users to enter the account balance, interest rate, and term for a savings account and a CD account.  The interest earned and updated balance are presented to the user.

The program uses classes and functions to set the balance and interest earned.

To run the program, start with [customer_banking.py](https://github.com/mikeyms1/customer_banking/blob/main/customer_banking.py)
